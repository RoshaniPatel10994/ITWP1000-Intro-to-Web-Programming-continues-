<h2>Gorgeous</h2>

<p>
<a id="t1"></a>You should take it as a compliment<br>
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk<br>
You should think about the consequence<br>
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong<br>
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us<br>
He's in the club doing, I don't know what<br>
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)
</p>

<p>
<a id="t2"></a>Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine<br>
You've ruined my life, by not being mine
</p>

<p>
<a id="t3"></a>You're so gorgeous<br>
I can't say anything to your face<br>
'Cause look at your face<br>
And I'm so furious<br>
At you for making me feel this way<br>
But, what can I say?<br>
You're gorgeous
</p>

<p>
<a id="t4"></a>You should take it as a compliment<br>
That I'm talking to everyone here but you (but you, but you)<br>
And you should think about the consequence<br>
Of you touching my hand in the darkened room (dark room, dark room)<br>
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her<br>
But if you're single that's honestly worse<br>
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts<br>
(Honey, it hurts)
</p>

<p>
<a id="t5"></a>Ocean blue eyes looking in mine<br>
I feel like I might sink and drown and die
</p>

<p>
<a id="t6"></a>You're so gorgeous<br>
I can't say anything to your face (to your face)<br>
'Cause look at your face (look at your face)<br>
And I'm so furious<br>
At you for making me feel this way<br>
But what can I say?<br>
You're gorgeous
</p>

<p>
<a id="t7"></a>You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah<br>
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have<br>
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad<br>
You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah<br>
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have<br>
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats<br>
Alone, unless you wanna come along, oh
</p>

<p>
<a id="t8"></a>You're so gorgeous<br>
I can't say anything to your face (to your face)<br>
'Cause look at your face (look at your face)<br>
And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)<br>
At you for making me feel this way (feel this way)<br>
But what can I say? (I say)<br>
You're gorgeous
</p>

<p>
<a id="t9"></a>You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah<br>
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have<br>
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad<br>
You're gorgeous
</p>

<p>
<a id="t10"></a>You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah<br>
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have<br>
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad<br>
You're gorgeous
